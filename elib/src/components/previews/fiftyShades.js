          <p>
            When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young
            entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful,
            brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled
            to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve,
            finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana's
            quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her,
            too—but on his own terms. Shocked yet thrilled by Grey's singular
            erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his
            multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is
            a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When
            the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana
            discovers Christian Grey's secrets and explores her own dark
            desires.

              Anastasia “Ana” Steele is a 21-year-old English Literature major
              at the University of Washington, Vancouver. The story begins as
              Ana travels to Seattle, Washington, to interview 27-year-old
              Christian Grey, the mysterious CEO of Grey Industries. Ana is
              conducting the interview in lieu of her friend and roommate
              Katherine “Kate” Kavanaugh, who arranged the interview for the
              school newspaper but can't attend because she is sick with the
              flu. Ana finds Christian attractive but also intimidating and
              arrogant. After the interview, she is preoccupied with thoughts of
              him, and although she doesn't expect to hear from him again, he
              shows up one day at Clayton's, the hardware store where she works
              in Portland, Oregon. He says he's in the area for business and
              needs some things, including cable ties, masking tape, and rope.
              Ana notes that Kate would like to get photos of him for the
              article, and he agrees to a photo shoot at the Heathman Hotel,
              where he's staying. Kate, Ana, and Ana's photographer friend José
              Gonzales meet Christian to take the photographs. Christian asks
              Ana to get coffee. On that outing, he asks whether José or Paul
              Clayton, who was at the hardware store, are her boyfriends. Ana
              says they're just friends. Walking back to the car, Ana asks
              whether Christian has a girlfriend, and he makes clear he doesn't
              do romance. Just then, Ana stumbles and is almost hit by a
              bicyclist. Christian catches her, and in his arms for the first
              time, Ana wants him to kiss her, but he won't. Ana assumes he
              rejects her because she's too ordinary for someone as exceptional
              as him. Ana and Kate take their final exams. As they're getting
              ready to celebrate at a bar, a package from Christian arrives. He
              has sent Ana first editions of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the
              d'Urbervilles and included a handwritten note on a card, a quote
              from the novel. At the bar, Ana gets drunk and calls Christian to
              say she plans to return his gift. He hears that she's drunk and
              demands she tell him which bar she's at. She refuses, but he
              tracks her down through her phone. He arrives just as José
              confesses his feelings to Ana. José tries to kiss her, despite her
              protests, and Christian tells José to back off. Ana vomits and
              soon after faints into Christian's arms. Meanwhile, Kate and
              Christian's brother Elliot make a romantic connection on the dance
              floor. Upon waking the next morning in Christian's hotel suite,
              Ana learns nothing sexual happened between them. Christian claims
              he won't touch her until he has written consent, but he gives in
              to his desire to kiss her in the elevator. Kate and Elliot are in
              Kate and Ana's apartment when they arrive. Christian encourages
              Elliot to leave with him, and Elliot kisses Kate goodbye.
              Christian tells Ana he'll pick her up that night for a date.
              {/* Christian pilots a helicopter to bring Ana to his opulent home in
              Seattle. There, he has her sign a nondisclosure agreement before
              showing her his “playroom.” Ana later dubs this room, which is
              full of BDSM gear, the “Red Room of Pain.” Christian learns Ana is
              a virgin, and he makes love to her. The following morning, they
              are interrupted by the sound of Christian's mother's voice. Ana
              meets his mother, Dr. Grace Trevelyan-Grey. Later, Christian gives
              Ana an additional contract, this one about dominant's and
              submissive's roles. Christian drives Ana home, and they stop for
              lunch in Olympia, where he shares that one of his mother's
              friends, Elena Lincoln, seduced him at age 15. Ana dubs Elena
              “Mrs. Robinson.” He reveals that he was in a dominant/submissive
              relationship with Mrs. Robinson in which he was the submissive.
              When Ana arrives home, she finds offers for several interviews at
              publishing houses in Seattle, and she admits to Kate that she and
              Christian had sex. Reading the contract overwhelms Ana, but she
              knows that if she refuses to have a BDSM relationship, she won't
              have any relationship with Christian at all. On their next dinner
              date, the pair discuss the terms of the contract and Ana's hard
              and soft limits. She wants a romantic relationship with him, which
              he refuses. Ana grows overwhelmed again, and she drives herself
              home. The next time she sees Christian is at her graduation, where
              he gives the commencement speech. Afterward, Ana gives in,
              agreeing to try to be his “sub.” The next time they are together,
              Christian begins her training with spanking. Once Ana and Kate
              move to their new apartment in Seattle, Ana spends more and more
              time with Christian in the Red Room of Pain. Christian takes her
              to his parent's house, and she reveals she plans to go to Georgia
              to visit her mother because she needs space from their
              relationship. Christian's behavior grows more and more confusing
              to Ana. She wants to understand why he won't let her show
              affection the way she wants to and why he needs to control
              everything she does. Even still, her feelings for him continue to
              grow. She thinks about him almost constantly, and they communicate
              incessantly via email. Christian surprises Ana by showing up in
              Georgia, and they spend the night and following day together.
              While in Georgia, Ana learns she got a job at Seattle Independent
              Publishing. Christian has his driver Taylor pick up Ana from the
              airport when she lands back in Seattle. Ana remains uncertain
              about whether she should stay in a relationship based on control
              and power when she wants genuine intimacy and closeness. Ana tells
              Christian she wants to know how bad the physical pain can get, and
              Christian hits her with his belt six times. She understands she
              can never be who he needs, and he will never be who she needs.
              Realizing the relationship is over, she cries as Taylor drives her
              home. */}
